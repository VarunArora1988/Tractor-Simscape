The tractor consists of the tractor body and powertrain attached to four tires: two front tires and two rear tires. The tractor body and powertrain constitutes of the engine, which is mated with the transmission and the body. The transmission is a hydrostatic continuously variable transmission (CVT) with one transmission pump and two hydraulic motors, one mounted on the front axle and one on the rear axle. The implement is connected to the rear axle and provides thrust to the rear left tire and rear right tire. The scenario subsystem models the initial conditions for tire-soil and implement-soil interaction.

A variable-displacement pump models the transmission pump. One motor is mounted on the front axle and the other on the rear axle. The transmission pump receives displacement command from the driver control system. Pipes model the hydraulic resistance of the transmission circuit. A fixed-displacement charge pump, that is run by an engine, replenishes lost fluid due to the volumetric inefficiency of the transmission pump and motors and also provides power for auxilliary functions. Check valves prevent backflow to the charge pump. Pressure relief valves release excess pressure from the system. Flow rate sensors measure the volumetric flow and pressure sensors measure pressure across various transmission components.

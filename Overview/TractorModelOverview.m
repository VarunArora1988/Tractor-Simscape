%% Tractor For Tillage Operation
%
% Tractor design is an important step to boost efficiency in the 
% agriculture. Developing a tractor model that interacts with the 
% environment requires an accurate model of tire-soil dynamics that includes 
% interaction of tractive elements such as tire and implement with soil, 
% which is a complicated problem to solve. You can accelerate the development 
% process by starting with a system-level analysis to evaluate the options. 
% This project shows how to create a system-level tractor model using 
% Simscape(TM), Simscape Driveline(TM) and Simscape Fluids(TM).
%
% * To open the tractor energy computation model for tillage operation, click
% <matlab:open_system('TractorEnergyComputation.slx') Tractor Energy 
% Computation Model>. 
% * You can define your own custom scenario and driver controls to analyze 
% the tractor performance.

%
% * You can visualize tractor velocity, engine, and motor speeds, and compare 
% measured input and output energies for various transmission components 
% using the Result block on the model canvas.

% 
% * You can visualize the flow of energy from tractor engine to various 
% components of transmission, and to the axles by looking inside the 
% Transmission Energy Chart Dashboard subsystem on the model canvas.

%
% This project shows how to parameterize components, assemble them to build 
% a model for energy computation of a tractor, and use the model to compute 
% transmission losses for a tillage operation.
%
% 1. *Parameterize Components:* The project contains custom library blocks such 
% as the <matlab:open('ReportTireSoilModelInfo.mlx') Tire-Soil Interaction> 
% and <matlab:open('ImplementBlockHelp.mlx') Implement> blocks. The custom 
% Tire block represents the tire-soil interaction based on Bekker equation 
% implementation. This includes tire tractive effort with slip, compaction, 
% and flexing effects. The custom library blocks serve as early-stage design 
% components for the development of a fast running system-level tractor model. 
% The custom library blocks use the Simscape language framework. You can 
% model a hydrostatic CVT transmission using the HydrostaticCVT component. 
% You can parameterize the custom components to suit your application.
%
% 2. *Build Tractor Energy Computation Model from Components:* Build an 
% energy computation model for a tractor by using the parameterized custom 
% components and library blocks from Simscape Foundation & Simscape 
% Driveline. To learn more about the model, see 
% <matlab:web('TractorEnergyComputationModelOverview.html','-new') Tractor 
% Energy Computation Model Overview>.
%
% 3. *Create Transmission Energy Charting for a Tractor:* After you 
% create the tractor energy computation model, you can compute the 
% transmission losses and visualize the energy flow from the engine to the 
% wheels. To create the transmission energy charting for a tractor, see
% <matlab:open('TransmissionEnergyChartingWorkflow.mlx') Create Transmission 
% Energy Charting for a Tractor>. This figure shows the energy flow of the
% tractor and was generated using the Create Transmission 
% Energy Charting for a Tractor workflow.
